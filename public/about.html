As the Editorial Committee we provide a platform for all who aspire to sharpen their skills in writing ,designing and editing to explore those areas. Articles are published weekly on the SES blog .The committee also works on a semester wise newsletter and a magazine at the end of the year. These various activities enhance the skills of students in editing ,writing and designing and provides them with an opportunity to be creative.</p>

We are responsible for all the SES social media handles (Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn) for publicizing the activities of the society. We do this by making posters. Some of the activities we post include upcoming meetings, events and Monday Affirmations. In this committee, one gets to learn how to create and share content and portray messages in graphical forms. We also seek to keep the members engaged in activities such as quiz nights. </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-900">Indeed, there is more to an engineer than just book knowledge. Soft skills are essential if one wants to be competitive and holistic in the job market.. One can simply not rely on theoretical knowledge alone to be marketable in the jobs space. If you are that person who is curious enough to discover what lies beyond what you learn in class, then the Corporates committee is for you. It aims to inculcate the student with skills such as entepreneurial skills, communication skills among others. </p>

For the inreach, we invite other people to JKUAT (mostly high school students) and offer mentorship to them about the various engineering courses.  On the other hand, outreach events entail going out to help in one way or the other. This could be donating to children’s homes or supporting those who need our help.  Our slogan is, ‘throw smiles like confetti’, because our mission here is to spread joy by giving back. Karibuni Outreach!</p>
