    </h1>
    <p class=" poppins-medium text-base" >
      The Society of Engineering Students is the official JKUAT Engineering Students Club.Established in 1994, the club has a membership of over 500 students from over 10 engineering disciplines.The club consists of 7 committees namely:Mentorship, editorial, projects, corporates,publicity, outreach and women in technology.
      Our members belong to various committees based on their interests promoting a holistic growth beyond class work. Through active participation in these committees, students acquire both technical and soft skills, mentor learn from their peers, contribute by motivating younger aspiring engineers.

For the inreach, we invite other people to JKUAT (mostly high school students) and offer mentorship to them about the various engineering courses.  On the other hand, outreach events entail going out to help in one way or the other. This could be donating to children’s homes or supporting those who need our help.  Our slogan is, ‘throw smiles like confetti’, because our mission here is to spread joy by giving back. Karibuni Outreach!</p>
