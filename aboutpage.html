One can simply not rely on theoretical knowledge alone to be marketable in the jobs space. If you are that person who is curious enough to discover what lies beyond what you learn in class, then the Corporates committee is for you. It aims to inculcate the student with skills such as entepreneurial skills, communication skills among others. </p>
