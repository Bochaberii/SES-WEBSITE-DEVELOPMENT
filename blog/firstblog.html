                    "Winning Tech Expo 13.0"

                        It was one of my best experiences to get the news that we had won the Expo. However, it was not a surprise for us since we were hoping and expecting to win. After weeks of putting in much work and delivering a splendid job, we knew it was only fair for us to emerge victors. My team and I bent over backwards pouring countless hours of brainstorming, coding and prototyping and I could not be prouder of what we accomplished.

                        Looking back on the journey, I am reminded of the power of perseverance and the boundless potential of the human spirit. It is a testament to the fact that with dedication, ingenuity, and a dash of inspiration, even the loftiest of ideas can take flight and soar to new heights. At times all odds were against us but we pushed on and did what we had to do. Finances were a major challenge but we devised ways of managing resources and maximizing efficiency. If not for our persistence we would not have got the chance to showcase our idea at the expo. Due to an academic trip we were not able to attend the last pitch by the Tech Expo board members and so we were not shortlisted to present it at the expo. However, armed with a deep understanding of our idea and unwavering belief in its potential, we were able to convince the board of its value.

                        I must give credit to my team members who are also my close friends. We are a team of five Mechatronic Engineering students in our fourth year; Mugi Mugendi-our team leader and ideator, Omariba Collins, William Musau-the present Academic Secretary, Owen Wafula and I. Everyone of us played a major role in the success of the project. Mugi was our project manager ensuring we met our deadlines. He was also very instrumental in interfacing the website and the hardware of the system. Omariba was the web developer who came up with its front end and back end. William Musau was the group’s spokesperson and creative in coming up with ingenious ideas. Owen and I made sure that the hardware and program code did not disappoint at the end of the day. Aquacoin is an IoT-driven prepaid water management system allowing people to pay for water upfront enabling people to better manage their budgets. It also comes with other benefits such as reducing water shortages by increasing efficiency of water use, since everyone is responsible for the water they use. One can also simply pay for and keep track of his/her water usage on a website. The idea was born by Mugi, inspired by the need to save on water costs and encourage responsible use of water. Being generous enough, he shared his concept with us and we were able to transform the concept into a tangible reality.

                        We also extend our gratitude to SES for creating an environment for knowledge sharing, problem-solving, fostering collaboration and creating a culture of continuous improvement and learning. I need say that this was not our first project as a team. Through SES we were able to learn on how to present projects at Hackathons and expos through effective communication and demonstrations. I can’t recall the exact date but a session themed on ‘how to present at hackathons’ where Kimutai was the speaker, really charged us up for our first ever hackathon held the following day. Although we did not emerge winners, the Kilimani Hackathon was an incredible experience and the beginning of something great, our first step to success.
